# Data streamer UI

The data streamer UI is called Research Data Uploader.

It is a web interface to upload files from a (lab) PC to 1) your project folder on central storage and 2) to the Donders Repository. The destination follows a standardized folder structure. Once the files have been uploaded to the streamer server, the streamer server will queue a streamer job. An e-mail will be send to you if the job has been successful or not.
